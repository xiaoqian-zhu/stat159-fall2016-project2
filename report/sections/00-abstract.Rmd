#Abstract


In this project, we are going to take a look at five different regression models, including, ordinary least squares, ridge, lasso, principal components, and partial least squares regressions. We are mainly following the analysis from _Linear Model Selection and Regularization_(chapter 6) of the *An Introduction to Statistical Learning* by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani. [Link to the book](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/). Apply each model on the data set _Credit_, [Link to the data set](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/Credit.csv), we predict the variable `Balance ` in terms of ten predictors such as `Income`, `Age`, `Education`, `Gender`, `Ethnicity`, etc and also describe the differences between these models.
